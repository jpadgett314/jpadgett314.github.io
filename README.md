# jpadgett314.github.io
This is my personal website, originally created for CS410 - Intro to Web Development at Portland State University. Having since expanded my knowledge of web development, this project's source code is not an accurate reflection of my current knowledge. It is currently deployed to https://jpadgett314.github.io/ via GitHub pages. 

The site uses icons from Font Awesome 5 and the typeface IBM Plex Mono from Google Fonts. It depends on nothing else; there is no Bootstrap to be found here!

Finally, note that the layout and appearance of the website are entirely based on https://www.mamboleoo.be/, though the code itself is completely original. 

## Resources used

The following tutorials helped me along the way:
 - How to use Google Fonts (fairly out-of-date): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-google-fonts-in-your-next-web-design-project-e1ad48f1adfa/
 - How to get text on opposite sides of the same line: https://css-tricks.com/left-align-and-right-align-text-on-the-same-line/
 - How to add icons: https://www.w3schools.com/icons/
 - Styling with Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/styling
 - A Complete Guide to Grid: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
 - CSS Grid Layout: The Span Keyword: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-span-keyword. This made it possible for all cells to be placed within the grid automatically. No explicit tracks needed.
 - How to Create a Collapsed Sidebar: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapse_sidebar.asp. I used this same technique to implement the collapsed navbar.
 - How to Create a Slideshow: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp. The slideshow does not appear in the final product because I could find no good place for it in the layout. The result always looked atrocious at some screen size.
 - CSS Change Border Color of Active Input Textbox: https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/css/css+change+border+color+of+active+input+text+box
 - Lock the Width of a Textbox: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8205384/lock-the-width-of-a-textbox, so that my textarea form element could be resized vertically but not horizontally.
 - How to Create a Smooth Scrolling Effect: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp#section1. For navigation autoscrolling.

## Time spent

Though it is a simple site, it is my first. About 30 hours were spent creating it.

## How to open

All of the functionality of this site is available if `index.html` is opened in a modern browser. Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension is recommended for editing.
