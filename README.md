# padgett3.github.io
This is a personal website created for CS410 - Intro to Web Development at Portland State University. As the repo name suggests, it is currently deployed to https://padgett3.github.io/ via GitHub pages. 

I first want to note that the appearance of the website it strongly based on https://www.mamboleoo.be/, though the code itself is completely original. 

The site uses an icon or two from Font Awesome 5 and the typeface IBM Plex Mono from Google Fonts. It depends on nothing else; all other interactivity comes from vanilla JavaScript or the built-in behavior of the browser. No bootstrap to be found here!

Special attention was given to responsiveness and smoothness of automatic movements. This includes the scrolling that occurs when navigation links are clicked, highlighting of hovered-over elements, and the collapsing navbar. The site also has 4 subtly different layouts for different screen sizes.

## Resources

The following tutorials helped me along the way:
 - How to use Google Fonts (fairly out-of-date): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-google-fonts-in-your-next-web-design-project-e1ad48f1adfa/
 - How to get text on opposite sides of the same line: https://css-tricks.com/left-align-and-right-align-text-on-the-same-line/
 - How to add icons: https://www.w3schools.com/icons/
 - Styling with Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/styling
 - A Complete Guide to Grid: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
 - CSS Grid Layout: The Span Keyword: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-span-keyword. This made it possible for all cells to be placed within the grid automatically. No explicit tracks needed.
 - How to Create a Collapsed Sidebar: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapse_sidebar.asp. I used this same technique to implement the collapsed navbar.
 - How to Create a Slideshow: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp. The slideshow does not appear in the final product because I could find no good place for it in the layout. The result always looked atrocious at some screen size.
 - CSS Change Border Color of Active Input Textbox: https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/css/css+change+border+color+of+active+input+text+box
 - Lock the Width of a Textbox: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8205384/lock-the-width-of-a-textbox, so that my textarea form element could be resized vertically but not horizontally.
 - How to Create a Smooth Scrolling Effect: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp#section1. For navigation autoscrolling.

## Time spent

Though it is a sipmle site, it is my first. About 30 hours were spent creating it.

## How to open

All of the functionality of this site is available if `index.html` is opened in a modern browser. Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension is recommended for editing.
